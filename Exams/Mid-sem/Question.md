# Mid Term 1

You need to submit your answers (typed/ cleanly handwritten) single pdf file before 5pm tomorrow (Sunday, 6th March). As I mentioned before, the work should take around 3 hours and you do not have to wait till the last minute to submit. Note that only one submission will be allowed.

Please do the effort by yourselves without any help from others or the internet. You may be asked to explain your answers at a later stage and if you are not able to, that would change the marks of the Mid-Term.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions:

In this exam, YOU are required to formulate three 15-marks questions from the topics covered in the course that you found to be most interesting and answer them. Each question that you formulate should be a single question and NOT with multiple parts. Also note that the question should not be simple factual questions or multiple choice ones (it should be worth 15 marks). Your submission should contain the following for each question:

1. The questions itself, stated clearly and unambiguously

2. Why is the question interesting (this is an important part of the submission)

3. Your answer to the question.

Your submissions will be graded based on:

1. The quality and novelty of the question (do not look for questions from online sources)

2. Your explanation of what is interesting about the question / answer

3. The correctness, clarity and completeness of the answer
