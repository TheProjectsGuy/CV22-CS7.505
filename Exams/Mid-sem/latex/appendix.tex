\subsection{Q3: Code for Bounding Box}
\label{app:q3-code}

The code for creating the bounding box is shown below

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{../python/bounding-box-loc.py}

The output of the program is as follows

\begin{displayquote}
    Center pixel is: 839, 234

    Vehicle BRD at (X, Y): 9.3510, -4.5330

    Transformation from vehicle to camera frame is: 
    [[-0.08715574 -0.9961947   0.          4.5329549 ]
    [ 0.          0.         -1.          1.65      ]
    [ 0.9961947  -0.08715574  0.          9.35097549]
    [ 0.          0.          0.          1.        ]]

    Camera projection matrix is:
    [[721.53   0.   609.55]
    [  0.   721.53 172.85]
    [  0.     0.     1.  ]]

    Rear axle in camera frame is (X, Y, Z): [ 3.70936019  1.65       10.10205256]

    Rear axle in image at (x, y): 874, 290
