Before answering the questions, it is essential to brief on Epipolar Geometry.

\subsection{Epipolar Geometry}

Consider the image below where two cameras are capturing the images of the world.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Epipolar Geometry}
    \label{fig:q2-epipolar-geometry}
    \small
        Points $X$ and $Y$ are points in the real world whose image falls at (pixel locations) $x'$ and $y'$ in image 1 and $x''$ and $y''$ in image 2. 
        The origins of these cameras are located at $O_1$ and $O_2$, respectively.

        As a convention, points in the first image have a single hyphen, whereas points in the second image have two hyphens.
\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Epipolar Axis}
The line joining $O_1$ and $O_2$ is called the \textbf{epipolar axis}. It intersects the images at $e'$ and $e''$ respectively.

\paragraph*{Epipolar Plane}
We know $O_1 O_2 X$ form a plane (they are three points in the world). This plane is called the \textbf{epipolar plane}.

\paragraph*{Epipolar Line}
It is clear that the image of $X_1$ in camera 1 will also fall on $x'$ (same line), similarly the image of $X_2$ in camera 2 will also fall on $x''$. However, the image of $X_1$ in camera 2 will fall at $x_1''$, which is on the line joining $x''$ and $e''$. This line is called the \textbf{epipolar line}. Similarly, the image of $X_2$ in camera 1 will fall at $x_2'$ (which is also on the line joining $e'$ and $x'$).

When $X_1$ moves along $\overline{XO_1}$, its image $x''_1$ traces a line in the second image (the \textit{epoipolar line}). Same can be said for $X_2$ and the first image.
